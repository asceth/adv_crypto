adv_crypto is the same library as erlang's crypto except it includes
sha256 and sha512 methods.  adv_crypto should be up to date with
the default crypto library but may be one version behind at any time.

If the driver fails to link on erl_interface open up c_src/Makefile
and change the erl_interface path to the one you have on your
computer.  Right now its set to link against OTP R12B-5.
